Sometimes you have a problem that requires the implementation of several proofs of concept which are not precisely clear to define in advance, as the designed solutions themselves are hypothesis to be tested and compared later.

This may lead to costly exercises which require some setup and the documentation of some benchmark results in order to make the comparison.

# Example: setting a CI config for a project

Test different solutions by making commits one on top of the other in sequential order. Then you can rebase, squash, cherry-pick, or delete the commits as you see fit once you have finished the experiments and collected the results.
