Create your first snapshot from a static HTML result you expect to see.

Refactor your component to pass the snapshot test you took from that static result, this time with the expected functionality.

This heuristic is designed to help you think about the expected output beforehand, something you should really be able to do in a design phase prior to implementation, as a mean to improve the quality of the product and the overall development process.
