## JavaScript

## Node.js and NPM

## yarn

Yarn is a package manager for Node.js projects.

## Setting up a CLI for your project (npm scripts)

The acronym CLI stands for Command Line Interface. Setting up a CLI is important because it allows you to interact directly with your program and set the pre-requisites for automation, by exposing an API that allows your program to interact with a host environment.

It is not recommended to run commands directly from the CLI using global installation of these dependencies, as commands running globally from different paths may have problems with path resolution, or it may run a different version of the depenency required in the project.

## Git

Git is a source control and versioning tool.

### .gitignore

There are files you don't want to commit to source control.

## prettier

Prettier is a style checker for JavaScript. Enforces the use of style conventions to ensure consistency and readability of the code.
